# Jackpot-Editor
Jackpot Editor is a web-based game editor optimized for online gambling games. As part of my master's thesis, which I took at Paf Game Studio, I developed a game editor to help the team (mostly non-technical developers) make their prototypes without a need for a coder. This editor serves as an intermediary layer between rendering engine (Pixi) and art designers.
